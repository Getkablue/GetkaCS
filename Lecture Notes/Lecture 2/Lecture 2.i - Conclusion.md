This has been another long one. Thankfully, you are through the worst of it.

Be proud! So far, you have tackled (at least):
- Basics of computing systems, operating systems, and command-line tools
- Basic programming constructs and concepts
- Intermediate-level concepts regarding data structures, algorithms and programming paradigms

You now have not only individual tools, but an idea of the structures you can apply them in. With what you've learned in this chapter, you are much better equipped to understand code that you come across in general. You may not understand technical specifics of a specific domain, or specific syntax, but you should hopefully feel more confident in analyzing what a program might be doing just by looking at how it is structured.

However, while we have learned to read, we have not necessarily learned to write yet. In the labs and assignments, we will apply what we have learned to modifying bigger existing systems and to making our own complex systems from scratch.

Speaking of that, we are done with the massive lectures! Believe it or not, there is not much more theory I know of which will have the same wide-reaching impact on your ability to analyze and write software as what we have covered so far. Hence, future lectures will be on more specific topics that are of interest to you, the students.

Rather, the bulk of the course from now on will be in Labs and Assignments, which will now be much more frequent. Lectures will be more limited in scope.

In the next lecture, we will cover a concept many of you may feel is curiously missing so far: networking and communications. A great deal of software doesn't actually need networking, but it's major enough that we can't ignore it. March, soldier!
