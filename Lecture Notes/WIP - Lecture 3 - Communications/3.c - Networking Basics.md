In the most basic sense, networking in software is one software process sending data to another process. Of course, it's extremely useful that this allows us to also communicate with another computer -- instead of writing the data to somewhere on our own system, we write it to somewhere the destination system can see.

As you might imagine, putting data in this "place the destination system can see" is conveniently made possible through a certain series of tubes.

A metaphor which is useful for both in-system and cross-system types of communication is the idea of a *socket*. We write data into a certain socket, and read data out of a certain socket. Which one we use is a matter of convention or preference.
