So, you have read all the notes in the Basic Program Structure series. You have been given the tools you need to write a program. Once you complete the assignments for this chapter, you will have completed "the walking". The features we've covered are present (in some form) in almost every programming language out there -- they are a "core set" of programming constructs.

But, dare I say it, you are not ready to run just yet, let alone fly. No, tossing you in a sandbox with a bunch of tools does not constitute teaching you. 

From here on out, I will expect you to know how to use the tools provided so far. Using those, we will tackle much more complex problems and use increasingly abstract approaches to do so. We will solve problems that don't just involve understanding the code we are looking at, but also require reasoning about *how we should* design programs. At the same time, we will learn to solve *actual* problems using *real* toolkits, frameworks and libraries, not just toy examples. Along the way we will probably end up learning a lot about the languages we use, and how complex software has to be to work on real systems. This means a lot of labs and assignments, and a lot of independent investigation. Lectures will be reserved for dealing with new concepts, while labs will handle specific functionality and tools you can use as a programmer.

As you can imagine, this will not be easy. 

Thankfully, if you have made it this far without dipping out, you **are** capable of taking on everything else in this course. Pat yourself on the back and get ready.
