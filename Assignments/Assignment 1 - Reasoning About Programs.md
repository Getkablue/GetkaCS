If you haven't already, you should read the notes from the Lecture 0 folder. When done, upload your responses in a new file to your CS4G repo which you made in Assignment 0.

You do not need to code for these solutions. Provide a thorough description or pseudocode and describe any assumptions you make.

1. Write your process down, as precisely as possible, about how to add two numbers. Whatever it is that you do in your head to add two arbitrary numbers, try to write that process down as pseudocode. Give it your best shot.
2. Using a combination of numbers, strings, and/or Boolean values, try to create a composite data type for ninjas and a data type for pirates. Do they share any common information? Are they semantically similar in any way?
3.  Now describe a data type for bananas. Then, describe a data type for banana trees. 
4. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of compiled languages and interpreted languages. In what cases might you choose one or the other?
5. Describe the differences and similarities between source code, assembly code and machine code.
6. Create an algorithm which will tell you how many days are left until someone's birthday.
7. Create an algorithm which will convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, and one that will do the opposite.
