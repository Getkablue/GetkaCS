You should have read all of the Lecture 1 notes up through [[Basic Program Structure VIII - Arrays and Collections]].

(Hint: use Google to see if there are any built in functions that can help you...)

Task 1: Write a C program that declares an array of integers with 5 elements. Initialize the array with the values [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]. Print the values of the array in reverse order.

Task 2: Write a C++ program that prompts the user to enter the size of a vector and then the elements of the vector. Display the sum of the elements entered.

Task 3: Write a C++ program that declares a vector of strings. Add the names of 5 countries to the vector. Sort the vector in ascending order and print the sorted list of countries.

Task 4: Write a C program that finds the largest element in an array of integers. The program should take the size of the array and the array elements as input from the user. Print the largest element found.

Task 5: Write a C++ program that takes a vector of integers as input. Remove all occurrences of a specific number provided by the user. After removing the elements, display the updated vector.
