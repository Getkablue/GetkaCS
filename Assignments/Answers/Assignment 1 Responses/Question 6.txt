D1= Current Date in days
D2= User input date in days 

if D1>D2; 
	then return (365-D1)+D2 

else

\\\Without built in date calculation functions, I am not sure if there is a way to write this algorithm 
automatically without manually inputting which months have 31 or 30 days. My solution can be 
imprecise and does not account for leap years.

\\\If I am required to have the user input their birthday in the month/year format, then we would
need to declare the range of days for each month, verify at the start of the algorithm whether or not 
it is a leap year, and then convert the months to days using the date compiled from the second step.
