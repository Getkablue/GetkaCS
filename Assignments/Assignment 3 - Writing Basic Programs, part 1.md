For this assignment, you should have read notes from Lecture 1, up through [[Basic Program Structure IV - Loops]]. However, the lectures alone will probably not be sufficient. Investigate independently to find solutions to the problems, and feel free to use Google. In particular I expect you to use Google to learn how to work with characters and strings.  But **do not copy solutions wholesale from online**. If you do that, you are cheating yourself. Use what you learn online to come up with your own solutions.

Problems may be completed in any order. Sometimes it is best to come back to a problem later. This will also get you practice with resuming from where you left off.

Complete the problems below in the listed language (C, C++, or either). Provide your answers as source code files and upload them to your repo on GitHub under a directory called "assignment 3". In this directory, also create a SOLUTIONS file which contains your explanations (if any) for your answers. The format of the README file is not important. However, future assignments may request you to draw or visualize a situation. Therefore, you may want to get used to producing these free-form responses in the form of a .docx or .pdf file.

In all future assignments, follow the same general scheme for uploading your answers (both explanations/answers and source code files).

Problem 1 (C++): Write a program that takes an integer as input and checks if it is positive, negative, or zero. If the number is positive, print "Positive". If the number is negative, print "Negative". If the number is zero, print "Zero".

Problem 2 (C): Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers and then finds and prints the maximum of the two numbers.

Problem 3 (C++): Write a program that prints the multiplication table of a given number. The program should ask the user to enter a number, and then it should print the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10.

Problem 4 (C++): Write a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number. The program should ask the user to enter a number, and then it should print the Fibonacci sequence up to that number.

Problem 5 (C): Write a program that asks the user to enter a positive integer and then calculates and prints the factorial of that number.

Problem 6 (C++): Write a program that takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. If the string is a palindrome, print "Palindrome". Otherwise, print "Not a Palindrome".

Problem 7 (C): Write a program that asks the user to enter a positive integer and then calculates and prints the sum of its digits.

Problem 8 (C/C++): Write a program that generates and prints a random number between 1 and 100. The program should then ask the user to guess the number and provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low. Continue this process until the user guesses the correct number.

Problem 9 (C/C++): Write a program that takes a sentence as input and counts the number of words in it. Assume that words are separated by spaces.
