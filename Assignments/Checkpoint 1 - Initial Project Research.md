Do this checkpoint after we have discussed your initial project idea.

This checkpoint is simple: Knowing what you know about programming, what do you need for your project?

Think about what would be considered a "minimum viable product" of your project. What is the bare minimum your project's outcome needs to provide? What would be bonus points?

Use what you know about classes and structs to think about how you might model your project. Are there any pieces of your project that would make sense as functions? As new data types? What objects would your program's logic primarily be working on?

Then, do some research on your topic of interest online. Are there any pre-made solutions? Any software packages which claim to do something you would need as part of your program? What language(s) are they in?

Try to make a rough sketch of how parts of your solution would communicate. Save this sketch so we can discuss it in class.

Do not actually write code for this checkpoint. Just write down your thought process and your rough sketch(es).
