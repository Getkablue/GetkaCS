# GetkaCS

This is a course designed to get people the knowledge and practice they need to start working on programming, whether it's for a hobby or for a job.

It is based in spirit on a course I once took which was a highly accelerated look at Linux command line tools, Python, C and C++. 
It provided me a good foundation on which to learn the rest, so I want to pass this on.
