Let's do some exercises.

Write a program that takes an input *argument* with some text and that writes this text to a file. (Do not use shell output redirectors for this). To keep it simple, it doesn't have to have some complex way of signaling options. Let's just say that the first argument received is the string to write and leave it at that.

While testing your program, you may be a little confused -- you know how to run the program from Visual Studio, but how do you provide command-line parameters? Right click your project, go to Properties. Under "Debugging" there should be a field that allows you to pass in command-line arguments and parameters. Edit that, save and apply.

Actually, along similar lines, try running your compiled program from the build directory directly from a terminal. As a forewarning, it may fail. If it does, show me the error and tell me what it means -- why did it fail?

Now modify your above program. The second argument that the program receives should be a filename. The program should write to the file with that name, using the text provided in the first argument.
