"Source control", also known as "revision control", is just how you keep track of your code, nothing more.

There are several tools for "source control management", including Git, Subversion, Mercurial and others. All have different ways of working. In this course we will use Git, not because it is superior but because it is very standard way of working. Once you understand the basics of source control, they all start to make sense, but each has its pros and cons. 

Please note that the above are all *tools and protocols*, not websites. Git is *not* GitHub -- I can just as easily push a git repository to bitbucket.org as I can to github.com. Sites like GitHub are just offering you a convenient storage place for your code.

For a streamlined graphical user interface which is locked to Github.com service only, install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). This is fine for most purposes. 
If you want the more flexible, powerful command-line interface, I recommend [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) . 

You should also get a decent text editor. I recommend either [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
