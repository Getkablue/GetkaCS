This isn't an assignment, but it will help you to make sure you can write basic Python.

Take one of the programs you have written previously in this course, ideally a reasonably complex one. Now convert that progam into Python. Don't necessarily worry about one-to-one translating specific constructs, but try to keep functions and classes as having the same meaning. Google whatever you need to in order to make it work. You shouldn't need external packages for this, the standard library should be fine.
