OK, so we've used an external package from Python. Let's do it now also from C++. This time, I will save you the effort of research by telling you to use **SDL2**, a library which allows basic access to graphics, sound, and user input from the keyboard

For this segment, follow the tutorial [here](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/msvc2019/index.php) , which is for VS 2019 but should not be meaningfully different for 2022. Make sure you also click on **part 2** at the bottom! That's the part where you actually use the library to make something happen.

You may notice that this is quite a bit of configuration! Imagine *all* your team members *all* needing to figure this stuff out for *every* library... that is a *huge* waste of time. In a later lab, we will cover using a build system, which will take some configuration up front, but will automate all these steps from then on.
