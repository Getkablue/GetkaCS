For this segment of the lab, I am asking you to do some research. Think of a task that seems of interest to you, and see if there are any packages out there for Python which helps accomplish it. Locate the package, find out how to install it (probably via pip install from PyPI), and do so. 

Come to me for ideas if you are really that paralyzed that you can't think of something to search for. It could be as simple as loading an image and printing some information about it. It could be loading and playing an audio clip, or even loading a web page and getting some text from it. Seriously, this is just to get your feet wet.

Now that you've installed the package, create a script that imports it. From there, add code to your script until you have achieved your task. In order to do this, you will probably also need to reference the documentation for the package, which should also be online.

Report to me about which package you used and how you achieved your goal.
