In this section we will briefly go over what you should do post install of Visual Studio to ensure everything is working.

First, *make sure you install the C++ and C options, at minimum, when installing Visual Studio, and restart your PC after you do the installation.* You can install any other language packs if you want but you want those for this course. You can always install others later.

Second, when you are starting a new project, make sure you select specifically the C++ Console Project. You might also be able to select "Blank C++ Project". Just make sure you select the one that specifically has C++. If you select C# or Basic or whatever, your projects will not compile. At this point, you can hit F5 or "Build and Run" to test whether or not the placeholder code it gives you works.

Third, some students have reported some issues with the compiler working but the path to the compiled executable not being found. Honestly I have no idea why this might be. Try restarting.

Also, Google the error, damn. What am I, your mother?
