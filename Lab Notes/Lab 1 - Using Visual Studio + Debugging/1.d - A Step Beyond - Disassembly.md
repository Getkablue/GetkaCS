One neat feature of Visual Studio is the ability to view the assembly code for a program, or even for a specific function. While the Visual Studio disassembler is not as fully featured as something built for reverse engineering, such as IDAPro or Ghidra, it is still useful for getting an idea of what instructions your program is being compiled into. 

Being able to understand this assembly, which VS renders in the Microsoft "MASM" syntax, is a nice skill to have when doing very deep debugging or when you are trying to reverse engineer a program.  

Based on student interest, a future lab may focus on basic binary analysis skills and reverse engineering. But this is probably getting outside the bounds of the course. In the likely event that we cannot cover these topics, I suggest looking online -- there are a lot of reverse engineering resources out there. I may also be able to help you separately, so contact me.
