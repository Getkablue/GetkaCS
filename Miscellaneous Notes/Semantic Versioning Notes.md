A *version* is a known instance or specification of a thing. In the case of software, the version refers to software with a specific set of features made at a specific time. Usually, this is expressed simply in the form of a "version number", following the age-old adage of "number get bigger" to indicate that higher numbers are more recent, more updated, and more complete.

"Semantic versioning" is a community-adopted standard meant to give a little more meaning to the version number, so as to standardize their use in a way that is understandable. The typical semantic versioning format is:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
Example:
3.7.9
```

In the above example, the major version is 3, the minor version is 7, and the patch version is 9.

In the semantic versioning scheme, "patch" version changes only fix bugs. They do not add features or make any changes to the meaning of results, only fix errors in the existing code. Minor version changes may add new features but may not change the interface. That is, a minor version can add a new feature so long as it does not change the meaning of my existing code. Finally, a major version change can change anything, including making changes that break backward-compatibility (i.e., which break code relying on it, a *breaking change*).

Not all projects follow these conventions exactly. A common extension is to append extra info to the end:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.EXTRAS
Example:
2.0.0.dev-05282023
```

The above example represents a development build of version 2.0.0 from a specific date. Other such "extras" include a specific commit hash used to identify the most recent change, a specific feature branch in source control, or others.

In general, by following semantic versioning, you can make it easier for people using your project to know which version they should use. If they are using version 2.99.99 of your code, and you release version 3.0.0, then they know that updating to version 3.0.0 may break their code and require them to make some changes, so they may choose to stay on version 2.99.99. On the other hand, they may decide that the newly available features in 3.0.0 make the effort worthwhile.

Many modern dependency/package management systems use a system of "version resolution" which can take advantage of semantic versioning. For instance, if I am writing software which relies on the dependencies "foo" and "bar", then I will need to make it clear which versions I am using. For example, maybe I am developing with version 1.0.0 of foo and 2.0.9 of bar. In the file that describes my software requirements, I may write:
```
foo ~= 1.0.0
bar ~= 2.0.9
```
This can be interpreted to mean "Give me a version of foo similar to 1.0.0, and a version of bar similar to 2.0.9" -- i.e., if a patch release is made for either foo (1.0.1, 1.0.2 ... 1.0.99...) or bar (2.0.10, 2.0.11, 2.0.999999...), then my dependency manager can choose to use that instead. Whichever component is smallest is used to do this matching, so in this case it will allow any patch updates.
If I specify "bar ~= 2.0", then it will allow any minor version and any corresponding patch version.

This flexibility is especially helpful if dependencies rely on each other, or have some other shared dependency. Consider a case where package "foo" requires *as its own dependency* the package "baz", any version. I (probably) don't need to include "baz" in *my* dependency file, because I don't care about baz, only foo does. But let's say "baz" requires, for some reason, bar version 2.0.7 exactly.

My dependency manager can read these flexible requirements and determine that bar version 2.0.7 meets requirements, and so will make sure all the packages live in harmony. For example, if foo 1.0.3 becomes available, then my dependency manager might decide to use foo 1.0.3, bar 2.0.7, and baz 456.96.69. This kind of dependency management can be a great convenience. For example, let's say we later find out that patch versions 1.0.5 and lesser of "foo" have a bug which breaks our code. We can change our requirement to be:
```
foo ^= 1.0.6
```
In which case our dependency manager sees "Any similar version greater than 1.0.6". 

These are not real examples, of course, and dependencies are managed a variety of different ways. But understanding these concepts in semantic versioning will allow you to write software with smart dependencies and will allow others to better understand the nature of your changes.
